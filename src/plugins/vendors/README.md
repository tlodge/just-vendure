* TODO

Need a hook here that creates a new admin user.  It needs to:

* create a new channel for the user
* create a new role for the user (with the channel name just to make easier to admin).  Give it the sensible set of default roles
* assign the default facets to the channel, so that users can use those facets when they create a new product
